# wellness.me

We are building a personal wellness tracker, allowing users to record critical metrics from their day-to-day life including but not limited to their consistency of exercise, duration of sleep, quality of food consumed, and overall happiness. As their personal dataset grows over time, users will be able to reflect back on their challenges and marvel at their growth through the trackerâ€™s statistical analysis and charts, reaching a uniquely quantitative understanding of themselves. Through this self-comprehension alongside the assistance of our goal-setter, our app will help users strive and reach a fuller potential in life. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
